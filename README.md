# Analyzing CTA Bus Data

Analyzing CTA Bus Data is an ongoing project aimed at understanding the Chicago Transit Authority's bus operations through interactive visualizations.

Currently, the project focuses on bus location data collected during February and March 2017 from the \#55 Garfield bus. At present, you are able to discover:
* When buses are dispatched throughout the day and week
* Headway between consecutive buses at each stop along the bus route  
* Travel times between any two major stops broken down by time of day
* Wait times between consecutive buses broken down by time of day

In the future I hope to expand the project to include:
* The ability to explore the data of 30 additional CTA bus routes including high-ridership routes like \#79 79th, \#66 Chicago, and \#49 Western
* An analysis of which bus routes most adhere to and deviate from their official schedules
* Access to the raw data and data processing scripts
* Improved visualizations and enhanced interactivity
* Improved functionality on mobile devices

## Acknowledgments
I started this project as a participant in the Spring 2017 [ChiPy Mentorship Program](https://chipymentor.org). I want to thank my mentor, Matt Hall, for his support and guidance while I learned Python for the first time. Special thanks to the program director, Ray Berg, without whose hard work and organization, the program would not have been possible. Data was collected using the Chicago Transit Authority's [Bus Tracker API](http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker.aspx).
